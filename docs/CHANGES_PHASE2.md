# Phase 2 Changes Summary

This document summarizes the major features and improvements added during Phase 2 of the KhaledAun.com project.

## ðŸš€ New Features

### 1. Authentication System (Supabase Auth)

**Implementation**: Complete Supabase Auth integration with JWT-based authentication

**Key Components**:
- `packages/auth/index.ts` - Server-side authentication utilities
- `packages/db/supabase-client.ts` - Browser client for Supabase
- `packages/utils/supabase-client.ts` - Utility client with error handling

**Features**:
- JWT token validation for all admin API routes
- Role-based access control (admin, editor, ops, user)
- Server-side `requireAdmin()` utility for protecting API endpoints
- Automatic token extraction and validation
- Proper error handling with 401/403 status codes

**API Protection**:
- All `/api/admin/*` routes require valid JWT tokens
- Role-based permissions enforced server-side
- Automatic user role extraction from JWT metadata

### 2. Database Schema & Migrations

**Implementation**: Normalized Prisma schema with proper relationships

**Key Models**:
- `Post` - Content management with status and risk levels
- `Lead` - Lead capture and management
- `AIArtifact` - HITL workflow artifacts (outlines, facts, etc.)
- `MediaAsset` - Media management with metadata
- `SEOEntry` - SEO optimization tracking
- `JobRun` - Background job tracking

**Features**:
- Proper foreign key relationships
- Status tracking for all entities
- Risk level classification for posts
- Metadata storage for flexible data
- Timestamps for audit trails

**Migrations**:
- `001_init` - Initial schema creation
- Prisma client generation
- Database seeding support

### 3. Row-Level Security (RLS) Policies

**Implementation**: Comprehensive RLS policies for data security

**Policy File**: `packages/db/sql/rls-policies.sql`

**Post Table Policies**:
- **Admins**: Full CRUD access to all posts
- **Editors**: Create and update posts, cannot delete
- **Authenticated Users**: Read only published posts
- **Anonymous Users**: Read only published posts

**Lead Table Policies**:
- **Admins & Ops**: Read access to all leads
- **Admins Only**: Create, update, and delete leads
- **Other Roles**: No access to leads

**Features**:
- JWT-based role extraction
- Multiple role storage locations supported
- Automatic policy enforcement
- Helper function for role checking

### 4. Realtime Features (Command Center)

**Implementation**: Real-time dashboard with Supabase subscriptions

**Key Components**:
- `apps/admin/app/(dashboard)/command-center/page.tsx` - Main dashboard
- Real-time subscriptions for leads, job runs, and AI artifacts
- Live updates without page refresh

**Features**:
- **Lead Funnel**: Real-time lead capture and status updates
- **Content Pipeline**: Job run status monitoring
- **AI Ops Feed**: Artifact approval status tracking
- **Action Center**: Priority-based action items

**Real-time Subscriptions**:
- Leads table changes (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
- Job runs table changes
- AI artifacts table changes
- Automatic UI updates on data changes

### 5. Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Workflows

**Implementation**: Approval workflows for high-risk content

**Key Components**:
- `apps/admin/app/(dashboard)/hitl/outline-review/page.tsx` - Outline approval
- `apps/admin/app/(dashboard)/hitl/facts-review/page.tsx` - Facts approval
- Business logic in `apps/admin/app/api/admin/posts/[id]/route.ts`

**Features**:
- **Outline Review**: Multiple outline options with selection and approval
- **Facts Review**: Fact verification and approval workflow
- **Risk-based Validation**: High-risk posts require approved artifacts
- **Status Transitions**: Controlled post status changes

**Business Logic**:
- High-risk posts cannot move to `READY` without approved outline and facts
- Low-risk posts can transition freely
- Approval tracking with timestamps
- Error handling for missing approvals

### 6. Enhanced API Endpoints

**Implementation**: RESTful API with proper authentication and validation

**Admin API Routes**:
- `GET/POST /api/admin/posts` - Post management
- `PUT/DELETE /api/admin/posts/[id]` - Individual post operations
- `GET /api/admin/leads` - Lead management

**Features**:
- JWT authentication on all routes
- Role-based access control
- Proper error handling and status codes
- Request validation
- HITL business logic integration

## ðŸ§ª Testing & Quality Assurance
